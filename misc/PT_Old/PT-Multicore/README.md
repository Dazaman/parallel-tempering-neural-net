# Parallel Tempering with Multicore implementation

We use parallel tempering and implement it on multicore for lowering the time cost of the algorithm for chaotic time series prediction in various benchmark datasets.

The code of the algorithm can be found in the `code` folder. The results may be found for some of the datasets in `results` folder.
