# Parallel Tempering with Random Walk as weight updation

We use parallel tempering with no backward propagation for weights of the neural network for chaotic time series prediction in various benchmark datasets.

The code of the algorithm can be found in the `code` folder. The results may be found for some of the datasets in `results` folder.
